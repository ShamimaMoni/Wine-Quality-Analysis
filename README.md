Tartaric Acis and Acetic Acid has almost normal distribution. But Citric Acid does not have a normal distribution. To see if there is any normality, log10(Citric Acid) vs quality is plotted.

Still no normality is not seen rather there are a lots of peaks which is bad.

<h3> Acidity vs Grade </h3>

From the boxplots, we can see that the rating increases with the increase in citric acid concentartion and with the decrease in acetic acid concentration. Tartaric acid concentration has no effect on the grade of the wine.
